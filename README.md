# HDLeatherArmour
An armor addon for Hideous Destructor

Adds a padded motorcycle jacket to the 
game, serving as a "poor man's body armor".
This improvised armour has a handstitched
liner made from scraps of kevlar, sourced 
from the bodies of dead soldiers littered
all over the place.

Not as durable as garrison armor, but less 
bulky and easier to stash in a backpack.

[AWL] - Leather Jacket (Worn)
